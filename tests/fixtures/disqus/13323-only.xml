<message><![CDATA[<p>In their paper, Fang, Bowen, and Casadevall argue that NIH peer review scores are weakly predictive of research productivity for grant-supported projects scoring in the top 20 percent. Fang et al. suggest that the findings reported by Li and Agha (2015) are driven by the inclusion of more poorly scored grants that were nonetheless funded. More specifically, Fang et al. argue that there is a markedly weaker relationship between peer review scores and grant productivity for projects scored between 3 and 20 than in the full sample considered by Li and Agha (2015). We first demonstrate that this conclusion is not supported by the data. Restricting our sample to only grants scored in the interval [3, 20] suggested by Fang et al., we estimate poisson regressions that parallel the specifications in Li and Agha (2015).</p><p>In the restricted sample, we find that the estimated relationship between scores and outcomes is slightly larger in magnitude to the findings reported in Li and Agha’s original Science paper, and strongly statistically significant.

<message><![CDATA[<p>The lack of correlation is a consequence of the high rejection rate and has nothing to do with peer review as such. Any given property is randomly distributed in the tail end of a distribution. If the high rejection rate is driven by extraneous factors, peer review necessarily reduces to a lottery.  This paper highlights the simple fact that the only statistically legitimate use of peer review is to eliminate flawed applications, not to rank those that are good enough. The greater the percentage of the latter that are rejected, the greater the lottery. </p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>We thank Drs. Agha and Li for their comment.  They report a statistically significant correlation between percentile score and productivity for grants in the 3-20 percentile range, while we have shown that the productivity of grants in this range is not significantly different between adjacent cohorts.  These findings are not incompatible.  The essential point is that the difference in the median productivity of grants stratified by percentile score is extremely small (fewer than 10 citations and about one-eighth of a publication in five<br>years per percentile score increment), whereas the variation among grants with any given percentile score is substantial.  Moreover, as discussed in our paper, even this tiny difference may result from factors other then the predictive ability of peer review.  The question remains whether the great effort and expense invested in stratifying meritorious applications is warranted by<br>the very modest (if any) benefit, given that the process also has considerable shortcomings, such as the potential for reviewer bias.</p><p>Where we agree with Drs. Agha and Li is that ‘There is substantial variation in outcomes… many highly scored grants produce few citations and vice versa. NIH review committees are not perfect forecasters of future research performance.  Of course, this implies that many worthy projects may go unfunded, particularly with paylines set at historically low levels.’  However, their statement that ‘There is currently no evidence that other systems of allocating scarce<br>NIH funds that do not rely on expert peer review could outperform the current allocation mechanism’ is true only because the NIH has not evaluated alternative approaches.  The logical fallacy in such arguments has been known since antiquity as argumentum ad ignorantiam, or the argument from ignorance-- i.e., the absence of evidence is not evidence for its absence. One might just as easily say that the UK and New Zealand use criteria other than priority scores to allocate funding among meritorious applications, and there is no evidence that these approaches produce inferior outcomes.</p><p>F.C.

<message><![CDATA[<p>The field of translational control of TOP mRNAs has been striving for a long time for the deciphering of the mechanism underlying the translational control of TOP mRNAs. Unfortunately, however, not only the present paper has failed to make this anticipated giant leap in our understanding, it has managed to introduce an even greater confusion to the field. Moreover, the authors have refrained to discuss the inconsistency of their observations and conclusions, with that of data established in the field for the last 25 years or so, as detailed in the following comments on various results and statements within the text:</p><p><strong>1) Citation:</strong> <em>“LARP1 bound most strongly to 3’UTRs of TR and RP mRNAs under growing conditions. Importantly, under conditions of mTOR inactivation, LARP1 accumulated at 5’UTRs, with the majority of 5’UTR binding occurring on RP transcripts”.</em> <br><strong>Comment:</strong> Multiple studies have repeatedly demonstrated that the most 5’ terminal 30 nucleotides, or so, within the examined rp mRNAs (encoding rpS16, rpL13a, rpL32) and non-rp TOP mRNAs (encoding PABP and eEF2) are <strong>both necessary and sufficient</strong> for conferring the typical translational behavior of TOP mRNAs on a chimeric transcript (human growth hormone or GFP) in various cell lines [see attached table and references (1-4)]. <br>Evidently, The 5′TOP motif comprises the core of the translational cis-regulatory element of TOP mRNAs. The function of this motif is fully reliant on its integrity and location at the 5′ terminus, to the extent that it is abolished if the C at the cap site is replaced, or even just preceded by a single A residue (see lines 10 and 14 in the attached table). Moreover, full manifestation of the translational control of TOP mRNAs, at least in some cell lines, appears to require both the 5′TOP motif and a CG-rich region immediately downstream (see yellow-marked letters in the attached table). Consistently, all it takes to convert a human growth hormone transcript, preceded by the first 28 nucleotides of β-actin mRNA, from a typical non-TOP to a typical TOP mRNA, is the substitution of just five nucleotides adjacent to the 5’ terminus, so that the transcript stars with a C residue followed by 6 pyrimidines [see lines 11 and 13 in the attached table and reference (5)].</p><p><strong>2) Citation:</strong> <em>“Surprisingly, 5’UTR LARP1 binding sites rarely overlapped with 5’TOP sequences, which are located at the 5’-most end of 5’UTRs; instead, LARP1 binds predominantly at the 3’-most end of 5’UTRs.”</em><br><strong>Comment:</strong> In light of comments mentioned in #1, and the fact that none of the established translational cis-regulatory element in TOP mRNAs contains any PES, except for the 5’TOP motif, the role played by LARP1 in translational control of rp or TOP mRNAs, if any, seems to be, at most, a secondary one.</p><p><strong>3) Comment:</strong> The LARP1-binding element in rpL32 mRNA, as presented in Fig. 1H, spans positions 38 to 47 relative to the transcription start sites [as identified by primer extension (9)]. However, previous studies have demonstrated that the first 34 nucleotides of rpL32 mRNA are <strong>both necessary and sufficient</strong> to fully confer a typical translational behavior, similar to that of the full-length mRNA, on a chimeric transcripts, even though this sequence is devoid of the LARP1-binding motif (2, 7).</p><p><strong>4) Citation:</strong> <em>“33% percent of human homologs of mouse genes exhibiting decreased translation efficiency were bound by LARP1 in mTOR-inactive conditions compared to only 12% and 14% of genes showing no change in or increased TE, respectively.”</em> <br><strong>Comment:</strong> Four high throughput analyses, aimed at delineating the landscape of proteins, whose synthesis is controlled by mTOR at the translation level, have collectively yielded 1124 different such proteins. Evidently, comparative analyses have revealed that known TOP mRNA-encoded proteins outcompeted the other mRNAs-encoded proteins, when examined for representation in at least two datasets (90 vs. 67, respectively), in at least three datasets (74 vs. 5, respectively), or in all four datasets (30 vs. 0, respectively) [for the comparative analyses see (10)]. Furthermore, while only one third of LARP1 binding to human mRNAs exhibiting decreased translation efficiency upon mTOR inactivation (the present study), mRNAs containing 5’TOP motif comprise 60% of mRNAs translationally controlled by mTOR [94 out of 157 mRNAs represented in at least two datasets (10)].</p><p><strong>5) Citation:</strong> <em>“Pyrimidine richness at LARP1-interacting regions of 5’UTRs is correlated with strong decreases in TE upon mTOR inactivation.”</em><br><strong>Comment:</strong> Previous studies have shown that LARP1-interacting regions at the 3’end of the 5’UTRs, in all examined cases, is fully disposal for translational repression of TOP mRNAs upon mTOR inactivation (see attached table)</p><p><strong>6) Citation:</strong> <em>“The dissociation of LARP1 from the PES motif in the 5’UTR and the phosphorylation of LARP1, which enhances LARP1 binding to the 3’UTR, are important processes in stimulating RpL32 mRNA translation.”</em> <br><strong>Comment:</strong> The transcription of all chimeric luciferase constructs, used in this study, was driven by a promoter of a non-TOP gene. This means that the 5’ terminus in any of the resulting transcripts contains no 5’TOP motif, as it preferentially starts with two or three purines (the default preference of RNA pol I), and it cannot be considered as an authentic TOP transcript (See comment beneath the table for an explanation as to how authentic 5’ terminus should have been designed).</p><p><strong>7) Citation:</strong> Fig 7B and the statement: <em>“In cells subjected to short-term LARP1 knockdown, the expression of eEF2 in the 80S monosome and polysome fractions was reduced.”</em><br><strong>Comment:</strong> EEF2 mRNA encodes a 858 aa-long protein which can be maximally loaded by about 26 to 30 ribosomes (on average, a ribosome every 30 to 33 codons). This means that most of the mRNA signal is missing, as it should sediment with heavy polysomes fractions that where omitted from the presentation. An additional missing information about eEF2 mRNA is its being a TOP mRNA (3). As such, eEF2 mRNA would have been expected to be translationally repressed by Torin1, as does rpS6 mRNA, but this information cannot be deduced from the partial presentation. Clearly, in the absence of the full polysomal profile, it is also hard to assess the effect of LARP1 on its translation efficiency.</p><p><strong>8) Citation:</strong> <em>“LARP1 facilitates mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and S6K1, a process essential for inducing translation initiation of RP mRNAs.”</em><br><strong>Comment:</strong> The hypothesis that rpS6 phosphorylation facilitates the initiation of TOP mRNAs has been repeatedly refuted, by biochemical and genetic studies with cultured cells (7, 11-13) and subsequently by genetically manipulated animals. Thus, the translation of TOP mRNAs is normally regulated in hepatocytes from rpS6 kinase deficient (S6K1−/−;S6K2−/−) mice (14) or in regenerating liver and serum stimulated MEFs from rpS6 phosphorylation deficient mice (15). Collectively, these observations indicate that TOP mRNAs are translationally controlled in an S6K- and rpS6 phosphorylation-independent fashion.<br>As for the role of 4E-BP in translational repression of TOP mRNAs under physiologically relevant stresses, has also been negated. Thus, eIF4E overexpression failed to relieve the translational repression of TOP mRNAs in mitotically arrested cells (16) or upon mTOR inhibition (17). In addition, 4E-BP deficiency failed to alleviate the translational repression induced by starvation to oxygen, serum or amino acids (18, 19).</p><p><strong>9) Citation:</strong> <em>“Our data demonstrate that the mutation of the PES in the 3’ end of the 5’UTR largely reduce LARP1’s binding to the 5’UTR of RpL32 mRNA and renders RpL32 mRNA translation resistant to starvation, suggesting that LARP1 binding to the PES regions in the 5’UTRs of RP mRNAs inhibits their translation. Furthermore, the dissociation of LARP1 from the 5’UTR of RpL32 mRNA requires both mTORC1- and S6K1/Akt-dependent LARP1 phosphorylation (Figure 3D), indicating that LARP1 phosphorylation by mTORC1 and S6K1/Akt relieves its inhibitory role in translation at the 5’UTRs of RP mRNAs.”</em><br><strong>Comment:</strong> It has already been demonstrated in 2002, that Akt (PKB) plays a critical role in translational control of TOP mRNAs, as pAAA-PKB, a kinase-inactive, phosphorylation deficient PKBα construct, was sufficient to block the translational activation of a chimeric L32 mRNA (containing the first 34 nucleotides of rpL32 5’UTR, even though they devoid of the LARP1-binding sequence (see comment #3). Instead, this inhibition, was strictly dependent on the 5’TOP motif, as overexpression of the kinase-inactive Akt1 failed to repress the translation of an L32 chimeric transcript with the same first 34 nucleotides at the 5’ terminus, yet whose 5’TOP motif was preceded by a single A residue (11).</p><p><strong>References</strong><br>1.Levy S, Avni D, Hariharan N, Perry RP, &amp; Meyuhas O (1991) Oligopyrimidine tract at the 5' end of mammalian ribosomal protein mRNAs is required for their translational control.
